We couldn't get grunt build to run properly.
So please do the following steps to ensure that your flappy experience are as
good as it's possible.!

1) npm install.
2) bower install
3) grunt serve.

and make a navigation towards 'http://localhost:9000' on your browser and
have wonderfull time

There may also be the issue of the styles not being picked up by grunt.
In that case you may see a bright red background and no graphics.
If that happens, Running grunt serve and saving one of the .scss files in app/styles
should be enough to kickstart the whole process.

If there are any bugs please try to contact me at either benediktt13@ru.is
or benedikthth@gmail.com

I am also very receptive on facebook -> benedikt Thordarson.
